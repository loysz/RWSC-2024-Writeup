## Challenge Description

The challenge was to uncover a hidden flag behind a WiFi password.

## My Approach

1. **Initial Attempt**: I started by using Wireshark to analyze the network traffic, but it didn't reveal anything useful.
2. **Aircrack-ng**: I then turned to Aircrack-ng and used the rockyou wordlist to crack the WiFi password.


3. **Success**: After running the cracking process, I successfully obtained the WiFi password and accessed the network.
